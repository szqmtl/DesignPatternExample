## introduction

This repository is to demonstrate the design pattern implementations in some languages, such as Java, Golang, Python, and Node.js. It also means that there are some reality logics ignored, such as object creation error handling, object search error handling, etc. Furthermore, there are some cases that are implemented for my learning purposes.

The implementations have been grouped by the languages.

The order of the patterns follows the one in GoF book, and the examples are also from the book.
